# S-Wallpaper

## Introduction

> A startup program that switches the wallpaper every time someone logs in, just for fun!

## Installation
##### Warning: This program requires the installation of Python 3.x, which can be installed from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

> To install, simply download the project to a file in your Downloads folder!

> Your path should look like this: ```Downloads/s-wallpaper```, where all the project files (```main.py```, ```images```, and ```S Wallpaper```) are in ```s-wallpaper```.

> Go to the ```images``` folder in ```s-wallpaper```, and add your wallpaper images to that. This folder is what the script chooses images from, and if you ever want more variation, you can just add more images in it!

> Now, open the application ```Task Scheduler```.  In the left bar, click on the ```Task Scheduler Library``` file. Then, in the right bar, click ```New Folder...```, and entitle it ```S Wallpaper```.

> Click into the ```S Wallpaper``` folder and on the right bar, click ```Import Task...```. When it asks for the file, go to the folder ```Downloads/s-wallpaper```, and choose the file ```S Wallpaper.xml```.

> Now in the popup, click ```OK```. After this, you can leave the app, and reboot your computer or logout and log back in, and your wallpaper should be switched!
